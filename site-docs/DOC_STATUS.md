## Conceptual Docs (site-docs/concepts/)

| Page | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| pipeline.md | complete | Rewritten: two-stage eval, batch evaluation (auto + manual paths), interval gating, per-strategy decisions, target routing, evaluation cycles, preview mode |
| narrative-arcs.md | complete | Updated: strategy-scoped arcs, `episode_tags` (was `episode_type`) |
| voice-memory.md | complete | |
| media-generation.md | complete | |
| targets.md | missing | New core concept — waiting_approval |
| topics.md | missing | New content source system — waiting_approval |
| routing.md | missing | New target routing system — waiting_approval |
| web-dashboard.md | missing | No page exists — waiting_approval |
| scheduling.md | missing | Covered briefly in config.md — waiting_approval |

## Configuration Docs (site-docs/configuration/)

| Page | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| config.md | stale | OAuth 2.0 env vars correct; missing sections: rate_limits, identities, content_strategies, platform_credentials, accounts, targets, platform_settings, max_targets, logging/LogBus |
| content-config.md | complete | |
| social-context.md | complete | |

## Getting Started (site-docs/getting-started/)

| Page | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| installation.md | complete | Accurate for current quickstart flow; targets workflow addendum in backlog |
| quickstart.md | complete | Preview draft → promote flow still valid; targets onboarding in backlog |

## Recurring Checks

| Check | Last passed | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| CLI docs are fresh (`generate_cli_docs.py` output matches committed) | 2026-04-05 | |
| `mkdocs.yml` nav entries match files in `site-docs/cli/` | 2026-04-05 | |
| OAuth env vars in config.md use OAuth 2.0 names (`X_CLIENT_ID`, not `CONSUMER_KEY`) | 2026-04-05 | |
| `ruff check src/ tests/` passes | 2026-04-05 | |
| `mypy src/social_hook/` has no new errors (only pre-existing library stub issues) | 2026-04-05 | 28 errors, all `import-untyped` or pre-existing |
| All CLI commands with poor/partial docstrings have been enriched | 2026-04-05 | 16 commands across 6 files enriched |
| `pipeline.md` accurately describes the two-stage evaluation flow and targets path | 2026-04-05 | |
| `narrative-arcs.md` uses `episode_tags` (not `episode_type`) and documents strategy-scoped arcs | 2026-04-05 | |
| All interactive CLI commands (e.g., `credentials add`) have documented non-interactive equivalents for agent/CI use | 2026-04-05 | `credentials add --set`, all destructive commands have `--yes`; `setup` wizard → write config.yaml directly |
