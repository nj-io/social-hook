# social-hook CLI Reference

Automated social media content from development activity.

## Global Options

These options can be placed before any command.

**Options:**

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--config`, `-c` | path |  | Override config location |
| `--dry-run` | boolean | false | Run full pipeline without posting or DB writes (for testing) |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | boolean | false | Verbose output |
| `--json` | boolean | false | JSON output for scripting |

## Command Groups

| Group | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`account`](account.md) | Manage OAuth-authenticated platform accounts (X, LinkedIn). |
| [`advisory`](advisory.md) | Manage advisory items — operator action items for manual tasks. |
| [`arc`](arc.md) | Manage narrative arcs — multi-post story threads that give a series of drafts a coherent throughline. |
| [`bot`](bot.md) | Start, stop, and check status of the messaging bot daemon (Telegram, Discord). |
| [`brief`](brief.md) | View and edit the project brief used by the evaluator and drafter. |
| [`config`](config.md) | Show, get, or set configuration values in config.yaml. |
| [`content`](content.md) | Submit content ideas, combine topics, and trigger hero launch drafts. |
| [`credentials`](credentials.md) | Manage API keys and secrets in ~/.social-hook/.env. |
| [`cycles`](cycles.md) | Inspect evaluation cycle history and per-strategy outcomes. |
| [`decision`](decision.md) | View and manage evaluator decisions — the per-strategy draft/skip/hold verdicts from each evaluation cycle. |
| [`draft`](draft.md) | Manage the draft lifecycle: approve, reject, schedule, edit, redraft, cancel, and post content drafts. |
| [`inspect`](inspect.md) | Inspect system internals: recent log entries, pending drafts, LLM token usage, and platform connection status. |
| [`journey`](journey.md) | Control Development Journey capture. When enabled, Claude Code hooks record session narratives that feed into the evaluation pipeline as rich development context. |
| [`logs`](logs.md) | Query structured log entries, tail live output, clear old logs, and check system health. |
| [`manual`](manual.md) | Run pipeline steps manually — evaluate a commit, draft content, consolidate holds, or post a draft — bypassing the scheduler. |
| [`media`](media.md) | Manage generated media assets: garbage-collect orphaned files. |
| [`memory`](memory.md) | Manage voice memories — persistent style hints the drafter uses to shape tone and content. |
| [`project`](project.md) | Register and manage projects. A project links a git repository (or folder) to Social Hook so commits are evaluated, content is drafted, and briefs are maintained. |
| [`snapshot`](snapshot.md) | Save, restore, and manage database snapshots for backup, testing, or rollback. |
| [`strategy`](strategy.md) | View and customize content strategies (voice, audience, editorial rules). |
| [`target`](target.md) | Configure where content is distributed (account + destination + strategy). |
| [`topics`](topics.md) | Manage the prioritised content topic queue per strategy. |
