## Global Options

## Command Groups

| Group | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`account`](account.md) | Manage OAuth-authenticated platform accounts (X, LinkedIn). |
| [`advisory`](advisory.md) | Manage advisory items — operator action items for manual tasks. |
| [`arc`](arc.md) | Manage narrative arcs. |
| [`bot`](bot.md) | Bot daemon management. |
| [`brief`](brief.md) | View and edit the project brief used by the evaluator and drafter. |
| [`config`](config.md) | View and modify configuration. |
| [`content`](content.md) | Submit content ideas, combine topics, and trigger hero launch drafts. |
| [`credentials`](credentials.md) | Manage API keys and secrets in ~/.social-hook/.env. |
| [`cycles`](cycles.md) | Inspect evaluation cycle history and per-strategy outcomes. |
| [`decision`](decision.md) | View, delete, retrigger, or rewind evaluation decisions. Decisions record why a commit was drafted or skipped and can be replayed to regenerate content. |
| [`draft`](draft.md) | Draft lifecycle management. |
| [`inspect`](inspect.md) | Inspect system state. |
| [`journey`](journey.md) | Control Development Journey capture. When enabled, Claude Code hooks record session narratives that feed into the evaluation pipeline as rich development context. |
| [`logs`](logs.md) | Log queries, tailing, and health. |
| [`manual`](manual.md) | Run pipeline steps by hand. Evaluate a commit, draft content, consolidate a thread, or post a draft — outside the normal automated flow. |
| [`media`](media.md) | Manage generated media assets. Run garbage collection to remove orphaned images and other media files that are no longer referenced by any draft. |
| [`memory`](memory.md) | Manage voice memories. |
| [`project`](project.md) | Register and manage projects. A project links a git repository (or folder) to Social Hook so commits are evaluated, content is drafted, and briefs are maintained. |
| [`snapshot`](snapshot.md) | DB snapshot management. |
| [`strategy`](strategy.md) | View and customize content strategies (voice, audience, editorial rules). |
| [`target`](target.md) | Configure where content is distributed (account + destination + strategy). |
| [`topics`](topics.md) | Manage the prioritised content topic queue per strategy. |
