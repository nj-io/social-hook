# social-hook CLI Reference

Automated social media content from development activity.

## Global Options

These options can be placed before any command.

**Options:**

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--config`, `-c` | path |  | Override config location |
| `--dry-run` | boolean | false | Run full pipeline without posting or DB writes (for testing) |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | boolean | false | Verbose output |
| `--json` | boolean | false | JSON output for scripting |

## Command Groups

| Group | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`account`](account.md) | Manage OAuth-authenticated platform accounts (X, LinkedIn). |
| [`advisory`](advisory.md) | Manage advisory items — operator action items for manual tasks. |
| [`arc`](arc.md) | Create and manage narrative arcs — multi-episode story threads that give your content thematic continuity across commits. |
| [`bot`](bot.md) | Manage the background bot daemon that monitors git hooks and runs the evaluation pipeline continuously. |
| [`brief`](brief.md) | View and edit the project brief used by the evaluator and drafter. |
| [`config`](config.md) | View and modify configuration via dotted-key paths. Reads from config.yaml with project-level overrides. |
| [`content`](content.md) | Submit content ideas, combine topics, and trigger hero launch drafts. |
| [`credentials`](credentials.md) | Manage API keys and secrets in ~/.social-hook/.env. |
| [`cycles`](cycles.md) | Inspect evaluation cycle history and per-strategy outcomes. |
| [`decision`](decision.md) | Manage evaluator decisions on commits. Delete decisions (cascading to drafts) or re-trigger evaluation with a fresh LLM pass. |
| [`draft`](draft.md) | Manage the full draft lifecycle — approval, scheduling, posting, media editing, redrafting, and promotion from preview to live accounts. |
| [`inspect`](inspect.md) | Query system state: recent evaluation decisions, drafts awaiting action, and LLM token usage with cost breakdowns. |
| [`journey`](journey.md) | Control Development Journey capture. When enabled, Claude Code hooks record session narratives that feed into the evaluation pipeline as rich development context. |
| [`logs`](logs.md) | Query stored errors by severity and component, tail live log files, clear old entries, and check system health. |
| [`manual`](manual.md) | Trigger evaluation, drafting, consolidation, and posting manually — bypass the automatic pipeline for one-off operations. |
| [`media`](media.md) | Garbage-collect orphaned media files from the cache to reclaim disk space. |
| [`memory`](memory.md) | Manage voice memories — timestamped feedback that shapes future drafts by teaching the evaluator what works for your voice. |
| [`project`](project.md) | Register and manage projects. A project links a git repository (or folder) to Social Hook so commits are evaluated, content is drafted, and briefs are maintained. |
| [`snapshot`](snapshot.md) | Save and restore point-in-time database snapshots before major operations, or reset to a clean state. |
| [`strategy`](strategy.md) | View and customize content strategies (voice, audience, editorial rules). |
| [`target`](target.md) | Configure where content is distributed (account + destination + strategy). |
| [`topics`](topics.md) | Manage the prioritised content topic queue per strategy. |
